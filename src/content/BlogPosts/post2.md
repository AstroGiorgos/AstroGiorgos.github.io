I am very pleased to have received new funding from the Villum Foundation. This grant is awarded as a YIP+ extension to my Villum Young Investigator (YIP) grant, originally obtained in 2018.


BlackTiDE focuses on the study of radiation from stars that are torn apart by the tidal forces of supermassive black holes. The project will identify large samples of these tidal disruption events in upcoming wide-field surveys and will use light echoes and time delays to probe the structure of the emitting regions close to the black hole.

By applying these techniques across a wide range of distances, black hole masses, and host galaxy types, BlackTiDE will provide new insight into black hole populations that are otherwise difficult to access. The grant will fund one postdoctoral researcher and one PhD student.
