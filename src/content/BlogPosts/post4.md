RISOTTO is a new project that has been approved as a Large Programme by ESO. Over the next two years, RISOTTO will be allocated 334 hours of telescope time to obtain spectroscopy of transients discovered by Rubin LSST, using the X-shooter and FORS2 instruments at the VLT.

Together, LSST and RISOTTO will probe a region of parameter space that is largely unexplored in transient astronomy, combining unprecedented discovery rates with rapid, high-quality spectroscopic follow-up.

RISOTTO stands for Rubin–ESO Investigative Spectroscopy Of Target Transient Objects.

I was involved in RISOTTO from its conception, and I am very excited to see the project approved and moving into the operational phase.

<em>Stay tuned!</em>
